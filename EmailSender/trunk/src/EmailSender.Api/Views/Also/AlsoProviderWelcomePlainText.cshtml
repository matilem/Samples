Templated Email to Send Each Course Registrant

(Please copy and paste all the following to the body of your email to each learner and fill in areas in red with your specific course information prior to sending).

Email Subject Line: ALSO Provider Course Online Access

Body of Email:
Welcome to the Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO) Course! This course is divided into two activities: Online and Live.

Completion of all required online materials must be achieved at least 24 hours prior to the start of the live course. Online elements are designed to be completed at your own pace a little at a time, rather than all at once. It is highly recommended to allow at least 9 collective hours to successfully achieve online course completion.

Attendance at the live course will include multiple hands-on skills workstations and group testing scenarios. This allows learners to apply and practice the content they learned from the online course in a team-based setting.

Please visit http://www.aafp.org/provider-online and follow the steps provided there to begin the course. Use the Discount Code @Model.DiscountCode to add the ALSO Provider Course to your AAFP account. Add this online course to your account ONLY ONCE to prevent you from being charged additional fees for the course. To prevent errors to your AAFP Account and ALSO Record, please DO NOT create another AAFP account if you already have one. You may contact the AAFP Member Resource Center at 1-800-274-2237 during regular business hours for assistance if you have forgotten your AAFP account number and/or password.

As a reminder, the live portion of the course will be held at <INSERT EXACT LOCATION WHERE COURSE WILL BE HELD> on @Model.ActivityDateDisplay from <INSERT TIME OF COURSE>.
