    Welcome to the Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO) Course! This course is divided into two activities: Online and Live.
</p>

<p>
    Completion of all required online materials must be achieved at least 24 hours prior to the start of the live course. Online elements are designed to be completed at your own pace a little at a time, rather than all at once. It is highly recommended to allow <strong><u>at least 9 collective hours</u></strong> to successfully achieve online course completion.
</p>

<p>
    Attendance at the live course will include multiple hands-on skills workstations and group testing scenarios. This allows learners to apply and practice the content they learned from the online course in a team-based setting.
</p>

<p>
    Please visit <a href="www.aafp.org/provider-online">www.aafp.org/provider-online</a> and follow the steps provided there to begin the course. Use the <span style="background-color:#FFFF00;">Discount Code <strong>@Model.DiscountCode</strong></span> to add the ALSO Provider Course to your AAFP account.

    As a reminder, the live portion of the course will be held at <strong><font color="red">&lt;INSERT EXACT LOCATION WHERE COURSE WILL BE HELD&gt;</font></strong> on @Model.ActivityDateDisplay from <strong><font color="red">&lt;INSERT TIME OF COURSE&gt;</font></strong>. After you access the online content, we recommend you spend a few minutes paying close attention to the Overview Page section which states, "Click here to watch a helpful instructional video about this course." There are tips on how to navigate the online content and what sections to pay close attention to in order to come fully prepared to the live course.
